## Description


The motivation behind this prework study guide was to develop and showcase the connection and the interactivness between HTML , CSS, and JavaScript while learning the dynamic between that of git and feature branches. The reason of building this project was for the purpose oF studying more efficiently by having all HTML,CSS,JavaSripts and Git notes on one website sectioned to its corresponding topic, organizing the layout with the help of css dividing the contents on the webpage for the user to review note topics selected by a random selection from javascript functions. I learned how to use html as the framework for a website, the core start of web development and secondly adding* css (Casscading Style Sheet) for making the website look user freindly.
