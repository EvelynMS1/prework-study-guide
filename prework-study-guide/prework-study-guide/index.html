        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Enter your html notes here</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage usually in metadata not visible to the user and for the ability of providing information to the browser in order to render the web app correctly. also contains search engines and performace information</li>
          <li>The body element represent the visible content to the user.</li>
          <li>Semantic elements are specific elements with a task or purpose in detail assigned to them, as they provide structure and layout and make the website easier for browsers to work with when it comes to accessibility.</li>
          <li>html can be compared to building a structure of a house, html is the foundation and structure of the house or in other words the framework, the purpose of html is building a sturdy framework</li>
          <li>htmls framework consists of a head body main and footer</li>
          <li>there is usually one h1 that is included in an html document </li>
          <li>content of elements are always encased in between tags &lt; >"</li>
          <li>src stands for source of the code and is a link of source that is being embeded on a web app such as an img had a src that is embeded in order to display image on web page.</li>
          <li> the main root of the document is when the decleration of the html page is commenced</li>
          <li>html is a standard markup language allowing for web development, internet navigation(facilitating the navigation and inserting of links between related pafes and wensites aas html os heavily used to embed hyperlinks) and web documentation(possible for organizing and formating documents)</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Elements within the html can be styled in three different ways, inline, style sheet within the html doc and or linked to a seperate style sheet</li>
          <li>elements can be thought as contents of boxes which facilitates the concept of the box model which encompasses the padding border and margin</li>
          <li>The padding is within the decleration block therefore as the padding increases the element itself increases like the booty and the muscle within increases the booty the border is the lining of the butt or the skin and the margin is the space away from a physical object roughly imagined</li>
          <li>the manner in which you impose a style on an element is through a css selector and in some cases it may be the elements name itself, this indicates that the specific element is having a style placed</li>
          <li> the format of styling is usually the selector and within curly brackets the decleration section which includes the property and value itself</li>
          <li></li>

      <section class="card" id="git-section">
        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>git is a version control system, it facilitates the tracking of changes made to a web app </li>
          <li>the manner in which the communication between the doc and git is by using git commands which differ from bash commands.</li>
          <li>git and git hub have a system in which changes are made to the document and how it is tracked</li>
          <li>branch is a term that is used and has the function of seperating from the main branch of the document in order to isolate the changes that are currently being made, this ensures that there isnt hiccups that can harm the main branch</li>
          <li>merge is completed after a pull request, the commit the is pulled in(merged) from the branch that was created for the change and then deployed into the main branch with the end result being displayed on site.</li>
          <li>Github issues are a sub section of github that helps keep the git hub system organized and on track with changes as well as for monotoring progress more like a built in to do. these github issues are written with markdown language.  </li>
          <li>README's are included via github and are also written in markup language it usually inclueds the user story usually a description for the format of first person perspective of the user who will utilizing the web app including there expectations of the web app followed by the acceptance criteria which is a list of requirements that are needed in order to provide the final product written is as action taken "when" followed by "action observed" then </li>
          <li>Github is capable of expanding the capabilities of the integrated development environment(IDE- Gives us access to use code on our local machine and by syncing from our cloud based Github) with the usage of extensions</li>
          <li>Github inclues -source code editor, local build automation, debugger</li>
          <li>Github Workflow is the process of creating changes and embedding them into default working branch</li>
          <li>merging is the process of adding our updated edits from our branch to the default branch</li>
          <li>commiting and pushing changes and edits are ideal and highly recommmended for each and every change mainly bc it allows for the opportubity to go back to that specific state in the change process and make edits , while in the case of saving after multiple changes will have to be modified as a whole if changes need to be made. The other benefit of commiting and and pushing changes is that it allows for back up of work to remote storage meaning that the data is accessible from any device. Also allows for others to make changes and answer questions as well as suggestions</li>
          <li>pull requests - asks for the input and feedback from peers which is very crucial to the approval of merging the pull requests, once a pull request has been approved there is a follow up description of the change that was added to the default branch can include images links and tables to convey the explanation. finally the branch with the recently approved change must be deleted once in default branch for the prevention of confusion that may arise, take note that the one is still able to revert bak to old branch history if needed. </li>
          <li>pushing is only pushing to our feature branch aka not default branch, therfore to the github repo</li>
